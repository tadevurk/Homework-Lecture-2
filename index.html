		<h1> Student Company </h1>
			<h2> About Us </h2>
	
				<p> Haarlem Student Inc. is a company which is run by five students in Haarlem. This company was 
				<br>founded in 2020 to sell computers and laptops, especially to IT students. During the pandemic many </br>students struggled with choosing the right computers for their classes and this became our
				motivation <br> to set up this company. </br> </p>
			
				<p> As we mentioned above, we are students, and we know the position that they are in and therefore 
				<br>we sell affordable products. We are continuously researching new technologies and applying these</br>
				possibilities to our products. </p>
