		<h1> Student Company </h1>
		<h2> About Us </h2>
	
		<p> Haarlem Student Inc. is a company which is run by five students in Haarlem. This company was 
			<br>founded in 2020 to sell computers and laptops, especially to IT students. During the pandemic many </br>students struggled with choosing the right computers for their classes and this became our
			motivation <br> to set up this company. </br> </p>
			
		<p> As we mentioned above, we are students, and we know the position that they are in and therefore 
			<br>we sell affordable products. We are continuously researching new technologies and applying these</br>
			possibilities to our products. </p>
